 **Duration:** July 7 2025 – July 14 2025  
 

---

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to confidently explain and apply the following TypeScript concepts:

- Basic primitive types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, etc.)  
- `interface`, `class`, and `function` definitions  
- Typed DOM manipulation  
- Generic types  
- Namespaces and declaration merging  
- Ambient namespaces for integrating external libraries  
- Nominal typing using branded types

---

##  Tools / Environment

I used the following setup:

- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, or Visual Studio Code  
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04  
- TypeScript files (`.ts`) with mandatory newline endings  
- Build system: Webpack + `tsconfig.json`  
- Linter: ESLint (`.eslintrc.js`)  
- Testing: `jest@24.9.*` with TypeScript support  
- Validation: zero compiler errors or warnings

---

##  Configuration Files

Each `task_x/` directory includes:

- `package.json`  
- `.eslintrc.js` (where applicable)  
- `tsconfig.json`  
- `webpack.config.js`

##  Tasks Summary

### Task 0 – Student Interface & Table

- Defined `interface Student { firstName: string; lastName: string; age: number; location: string }`  
- Created two `Student` instances in `studentsList`  
- Rendered a table showing each student’s `firstName` and `location` via DOM  
- Confirmed successful build without TypeScript errors

### Task 1 – Teacher / Director / StudentClass

- Defined `Teacher` interface with readonly, optional, and index signature properties  
- Extended it to `Directors` with `numberOfReports`  
- Created `printTeacher` (and its interface) to output `"J. Doe"`  
- Implemented `StudentClass` with `workOnHomework()` and `displayName()` methods

### Task 2 – Advanced Types, Employee Logic, String Literals

- Defined separate interfaces for `DirectorInterface` and `TeacherInterface`  
- Implemented their respective classes  
- Wrote `createEmployee(salary)` to return proper instance based on salary  
- Added `isDirector` type guard and `executeWork` function  
- Defined `type Subjects = 'Math' | 'History'` and implemented `teachClass`

### Task 3 – Ambient Namespaces & CRUD Integration

- Declared `RowID`, `RowElement` in `interface.ts`  
- Added `crud.js` and generated `crud.d.ts` for ambient definitions  
- Used triple-slash directive and typed CRUD operations in `main.ts`, matching expected output

### Task 4 – Namespaces & Declaration Merging

- Organized code under `namespace Subjects` in `task_4/js/subjects/`  
- Created `Teacher`, `Subject`, `Cpp`, `Java`, and `React` definitions  
- Employed declaration merging with optional `experienceTeachingX` properties  
- Validated functionality via console logs in `main.ts`

### Task 5 – Nominal Typing with Branded Types

- Defined branded interfaces `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits`  
- Implemented `sumMajorCredits` and `sumMinorCredits` to preserve nominal typing

---

##  Testing & Quality Assurance

- All tasks compiled successfully (`npm run build`)  
- Jest tests passed under TypeScript mode  
- ESLint enforced code style and quality

---

##  Submission & Review

1. Pushed all tasks under `0x04-TypeScript/task_x/`  
2. Requested manual QA review  
3. Initiated peer reviews via Savanna by **July 21 2025 00:00**  
4. Awaiting final correction link from Savanna

##  Engineering Principles

Throughout I maintained:

- DRY and SOLID principles  
- Idiomatic TypeScript usage  
- Secure-by-default DOM handling  
- Modular, accessible, and maintainable architecture  
- AWS-style module structure  
- Consideration for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance  
- Formal documentation and academic rigor
